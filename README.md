## Purpose

Brontosaurus is an open-source plug-in for Grasshopper (Rhino 6) created for the purpose of generating unit tests inside Grasshopper.

## Usage

Brontosaurus can be used when you want to create unit tests for your GHPython scripts/plugins or C# scripts and plugins. It will be also helpful to test your complex definitions created inside Grasshopper.

## Pterodactyl compatibility

It can be used with Pterodactyl, so you can create reports for your unit tests and save it in .html, .pdf, etc.
